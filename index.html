      <h2>Application Development Project (1st year)</h2>
      <img src="images/project1.jpg" alt="Web App Screenshot">
      <p><strong>About:</strong> Designed and implemented a secure web portal using Python Flask and SQL to manage student records and authentication.</p>
      <p><strong>My Role:</strong> Led backend development, applied encryption protocols for user data, and conducted penetration testing to identify vulnerabilities. Collaborated with teammates on UI integration and database schema design.</p>
      <p><strong>Work Process:</strong> Followed Agile sprints, wrote modular Python code, and documented testing procedures. Integrated SQL queries for CRUD operations and implemented role-based access control.</p>
      <p><strong>Results:</strong> Achieved 100% success with simulated audit requirements, demonstrating compliance with security standards. The project was showcased in class presentations and received positive feedback from lecturers.</p>

    <section id="project2" class="project">
      <h2>Application Security Project (2nd year)</h2>
      <img src="images/project2.jpg" alt="Dashboard Screenshot">
      <p><strong>About:</strong> Built a community application for the elderly in Singapore to join activities hosted by local volunteers, focusing on accessibility and safety.</p>
      <p><strong>My Role:</strong> Implemented the front end with HTML/CSS/JavaScript and designed the database schema in SQL. Integrated security features such as password hashing, input validation, and secure session handling.</p>
      <p><strong>Work Process:</strong> Conducted user research with mock interviews, created wireframes, and iterated designs based on feedback. Applied secure coding practices and tested against common vulnerabilities (SQL injection, XSS).</p>
      <p><strong>Results:</strong> Successfully completed project with flying colours. The application passed all functional and security tests, and was praised for its usability and relevance to community needs.</p>

    <!-- Project 3 -->
    <section id="project3" class="project">
      <h2>Python Student Information Manager for Teachers (2nd year)</h2>
      <img src="images/project3.jpg" alt="Code Screenshot">
      <p><strong>About:</strong> Developed a streamlined Python program that allows teachers to manage student groups, track performance, and generate reports.</p>
      <p><strong>Features:</strong> Functions for finding, sorting, displaying, and inputting student data. Designed with a simple text-based interface for ease of use.</p>
      <p><strong>My Role:</strong> Wrote the full Python codebase, focusing on error handling, data validation, and user experience. Designed algorithms for sorting and searching datasets efficiently.</p>
      <p><strong>Work Process:</strong> Applied modular programming principles, tested with sample datasets, and iterated based on teacher feedback. Documented usage instructions and created test cases to validate functionality.</p>
      <p><strong>Results:</strong> Application handled datasets with no errors and passed all functional tests. Teachers found it intuitive and reliable, making it a useful tool for classroom management.</p>
